This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Little Buddha — local development

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the following pages while developing:

- `/today` — the guided 6-step daily practice
- `/journal` — read-only listing of your saved private reflections
- `/library` — view the 365-day curriculum (locked/unlocked view)

Notes:
- Data and journals are stored in `localStorage` (private to the device).
- The app uses Asia/Singapore date logic to determine when a day is completed.
- PWA support is included: `public/manifest.json` and a basic `public/sw.js` service worker.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
